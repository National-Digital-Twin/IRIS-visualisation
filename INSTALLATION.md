# INSTALLATION  

**Repository:** `IRIS-visualisation`  
**Description:** `Details how to install and run the software`  
**SPDX-License-Identifier:** `Apache-2.0 AND OGL-UK-3.0 ` 

## Prerequisites  
Before using this repository, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:  
- **Required Tooling:** NVM, Angular CLI

### 1. Download 
```sh  
git clone https://github.com/IRIS-visualisation.git  
cd IRIS-visualisation
```

### 2. Install Dependencies  
It is recommended to use `nvm` to manage versions of node, this project has been setup with an `.nvmrc` file so make sure to install and use this;

```
nvm install
nvm use
```

Create a personal access token on GitHub - https://github.com/settings/tokens - create a classic token with read:packages permission store this safely and make sure to add as an environment variable;

```
export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxx
```

You should now be able to run the usual install

```
npm install
```

### 3. Configuration  

For local development, create a `environment.local.ts` file in `environments` and a `\local\config.json` directory & file in `configurations`. These two files should have the same structure as the existing environment files. These local files are not committed to git, and can have any secret keys added safely.

Create a file called `environments\keys.environment.ts` and add your Mapbox API key and OS Data Hub API key. This file will not be committed to the code repository.

```
export const apiKeys = {
  mapbox: {
    apiKey:
      'your mapbox api key',
  },
  os: {
    apiKey: 'your os data hub api key',
  },
};
```

Run `npm start` for a dev server using the `local` app configuration. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The application also provides npm scripts for running a development server that will load the corresponding environment configuration.

```npm
npm run start
npm run start:dev
npm run start:qa
npm run start:prod
```

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Linting & code style

The project uses a combination of [ES Lint](https://eslint.org) & [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to execute code
linting and style checking. Check code linting and style using `npm run lint`
